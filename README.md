Heart Disease Prediction:
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data using machine learning classification techniques.

What I Have Done
Collected and included a dataset with patient features like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other health indicators.

Developed a Jupyter Notebook that:

Loads and explores the dataset.

Cleans and preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Builds and trains classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict heart disease.

Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall

Published the project publicly on GitHub to share the code and results with the community.
