Heart Disease Prediction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data using machine learning classification techniques.

What I Have Done
Collected and included a dataset with patient features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other health indicators.

Developed a Jupyter Notebook that:

Loads and explores the dataset.

Cleans and preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Builds and trains classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict heart disease.

Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Published the project publicly on GitHub to share the code and results with the community.

Why Heart Disease Prediction?
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection through predictive modeling can help healthcare professionals identify at-risk patients and provide timely interventions, ultimately saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.
